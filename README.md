## Procedurally generated mountains side project.

This project was made primarily to experiment with [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) and OpenGL. I have always had an interest in learning more about procedural generation.


I will dust this off and update this page with algorithm details and gifs and stuff eventually!
